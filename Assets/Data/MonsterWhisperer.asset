  description: 'Rogue mad scientists from a nearby city-state have intruded on a
    forest where villagers were living in harmony with nature, and are spoiling the
    land and its creatures with their cruel experiments. As the Monster Whisperer,
    players will have the power to recruit monstrous allies through conversation.
    Rather than capturing and forcing them to do their bidding, players will work
    together with and support them in battling the hostile scientists and their minions
    to restore balance to the forest.  '
